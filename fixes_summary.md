Summary of fixes applied:

## 1. Campaign Creation Failure - FIXED ✅
- Added `total_rows` field to `CampaignUpdate` model in `jobs/models.py`
- Fixed type mismatch in `api_extensions.py` by creating proper `CampaignUpdate` object instead of passing dictionary

## 2. Campaign Stats Endpoint Failure - FIXED ✅
- Fixed SQLAlchemy import issue by importing `func` from sqlalchemy
- Added missing `total_messages` field to `CampaignStats` model
- Ensured integer types for message counts to avoid JSON serialization issues

## 3. Campaign Details Fetching - POTENTIAL ISSUE
The backend returns the correct format: `{"success": True, "data": campaign.dict()}`

However, the frontend might need adjustment. In app.js, the `selectCampaign` function does:
```javascript
const campaign = await this.apiCall(`/api/campaigns/${campaignId}`);
this.displayCampaignControls(campaign);
```

The issue might be that `displayCampaignControls` expects the campaign object directly, but `apiCall` might return the full response.

## Suggested Frontend Fix:
In app.js, modify the selectCampaign function:

```javascript
async selectCampaign(campaignId) {
    try {
        // ... existing code ...
        
        // Load campaign details
        const response = await this.apiCall(`/api/campaigns/${campaignId}`);
        // Extract the campaign data from the response
        const campaign = response.data || response;
        this.displayCampaignControls(campaign);
        
    } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling ...
    }
}
```

## Testing Instructions:
1. Restart the FastAPI server to load the changes
2. Try creating a new campaign through the UI
3. Check if campaign stats load properly
4. Click on a campaign to see if details load correctly

If the campaign details still don't load, check the browser console for the exact error and the response format.
